TODOs
=====
* Add a lot of test cases.
* Move it to cdap-plugins repo. 
* Would be good to have the ability to get the input schema and output schema
  configured. This would allow one to perform validation of mappings during 
  configuration phase. 
* Support for multiple inputs and multiple outputs and their schemas available
  during configure phase.
* Having getContext() within realtime similar to one in Batch mode would be 
  make is similar. 
* Guide for building new UI widget would be very useful -- mostly internally.
* Should have ability to write to or read from any dataset in batch and realtime
  mode.
